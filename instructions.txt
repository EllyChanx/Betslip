Instructions
------------

Create a simple betslip application in React, which broadly replicates the styles and functionality, as defined in the mock-up.png file.

While you are free to create the application with any packages and resources that you’re familiar with, we are especially keen to see the following:

* React with type checking, i.e. PropTypes, or ideally TypeScript
* Unit tests written with Jest and Enzyme, or ideally React Testing Library

------------
Requirements
------------

Views: app should have two views – betslip and receipt
Filter: betslip should handle filtering of bets – both over / under 2.0
Input: betslip should handle stake inputs – with bet / stake added to betslip
Submit: app should place bets – with receipt calculating / showing total stake

Hints
-----

We are looking for clean code that you would be proud to submit to production. Ideally this should not require much feedback or iteration at the PR/MR stage.

You should think carefully here about how you plan to write well-structured and consistent code, i.e. good abstractions, minimal repetition, and well formatted code. Tools such as ESLint and Prettier are helpful here.

As this is a React application, we would encourage you to follow best practices. For example, aiming for declarative over imperative programming, and seeking to reduce side effects and impure functions etc.

---
API
---

The api exposes two endpoints:

* /decimalOddsLessThanTwo
* /decimalOddsMoreThanTwo

The endpoints return a json response containing real Oddschecker bet data that has been grouped into bets with odds over 2.0 and under 2.0.

---
Dev
---

In the project directory run the following commands to setup the development environment:

1. npm install
2. npm run start-frontend
3. npm run start-server

Once these processes have been started you will be ready to start developing.

The webpage for the website will be available on port 3000 whilst the api can be reached on port 4000 to request the bet data.
